Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. This can be a topic of interest for many parties. One of those could be any investors trying to open a business or invest in property in these cities. They will get a better understanding of the geographical advantages of each city and will be better able to leverage the advantages and dissdvantages of each. "

Data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that I explicitly describe the audience and why they would care about my problem. The lab done for New York gives the 10 most common venues in each district. The data set is about Toronto Venues. After transforming the data to Json files, it is easy to use Pandas to transform them into DataFrame. Then select the required data columns to appear and get the information we want. Geopy library is used to get the latitude and longitude values. With the locations the maps can be created and we will have a direct understanding of the neighborhoods and the purposed areas. The Folium library is also used to show maps on different requirements. Lastly, a different analysis on Toronto will give us better data to where and what to invest in."
